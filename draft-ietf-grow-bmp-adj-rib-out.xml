                The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to only the Adj-RIB-
                In Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  This document updates the BGP
                Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by adding access to the Adj-RIB-
                Out RIBs. It adds a new flag to the peer header to distinguish Adj-
                RIB-In and Adj-RIB-Out.

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="Introduction">
            <t>
                BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines monitoring of the received
                (e.g. Adj-RIB-In) Routing Information Bases (RIBs) per peer.  The
                Adj-RIB-In pre-policy conveys to a BMP receiver all RIB data before
                any policy has been applied.  The Adj-RIB-In post-policy conveys to a
                BMP receiver all RIB data after policy filters and/or modifications
                have been applied.  An example of pre-policy verses post-policy is
                when an inbound policy applies attribute modification or filters.
                Pre-policy would contain information prior to the inbound policy
                changes or filters of data. Post policy would convey the changed data
                or would not contain the filtered data.

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                Monitoring the received updates that the router received before any
                policy has been applied is the primary level of monitoring for most
                use-cases.  Inbound policy validation and auditing is the primary
                use-case for enabling post-policy monitoring.

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                In order for a BMP receiver to receive any BGP data, the BMP sender
                (e.g. router) needs to have an established BGP peering session and
                actively be receiving updates for an Adj-RIB-In.

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                Being able to only monitor the Adj-RIB-In puts a restriction on what
                data is available to BMP receivers via BMP senders (e.g. routers).
                This is an issue when the receiving end of the BGP peer is not
                enabled for BMP or when it is not accessible for administrative
                reasons.  For example, a service provider advertises prefixes to a
                customer, but the service provider cannot see what it advertises via
                BMP. Asking the customer to enable BMP and monitoring of the Adj-RIB-
                In is not feasible.

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                This document updates BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) <xref target="RFC7854">RFC 7854</xref>
                peer header by adding a new flag to distinguish Adj-RIB-In
                verses Adj-RIB-Out.

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                Adding Adj-RIB-Out enables the ability for a BMP sender to send to a
                BMP receiver what it advertises to BGP peers, which can be used for
                outbound policy validation and to monitor RIBs that were advertised.

                    The primary use-case in monitoring Adj-RIB-Out is to monitor the

                    applied. These updates reflect the result after modifications and

                    MUST be set to 1 in this case to indicate post-policy.

                    For example, a comparison between pre-policy and post-policy can be
                    used to validate the outbound policy.  The L flag MUST be set to 0 in
